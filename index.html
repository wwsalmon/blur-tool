            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>To automatically detect where faces are in a photo, Blurryface uses a face detection model called <a href="https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB">UltraFace</a>, based off of a state-of-the-art model called <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/paper/190500641">RetinaFace</a>. Specifically, it uses an <a href="https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/validated/vision/body_analysis/ultraface">implementation of UltraFace in a framework called ONNX</a>, which it then runs in the app using WebAssembly through <code>onnxruntime-web</code>.</p>
            <p>Blurryface then uses a Javascript library called <a href="https://github.com/jimp-dev/jimp">Jimp</a> to blur the faces in the photo.</p>
            <h3>Are my photos uploaded to a server?</h3>
            <p><b>No, nothing is uploaded to or downloaded from the internet when running Blurryface.</b> The face detection model runs entirely on your computer. The entire model runtime and weights are <a href="https://github.com/wwsalmon/blurryface/tree/main/p3-onnx-full/public">bundled with the app itself</a>.</p>
            <h3>Can I request new features in the app?</h3>
            <p><b>Yes, email me at <a href="mailto:hello@samsonzhang.com">hello@samsonzhang.com</a> with feedback.</b> I will not be working on this app consistently, but if I can I want to make this app useful for organizers, movement journalists, and others handling sensitive photos.</p>
            <p>If you are a developer (especially with web development experience, as this app is built using web technologies and Tauri), please also feel free to <a href="https://github.com/wwsalmon/blurryface/issues">leave an issue on GitHub or open a pull request</a> if you want to implement something yourself. It's a pretty straightforward app so far and I've written developer documentation in the repo.</p>
            <h3>Who are you? Why did you make this app?</h3>
            <p>I'm a <a href="https://twitter.com/wwsalmon">student journalist</a> who has had to do a lot of blurring of photos and videos manually <a href="https://www.instagram.com/claremont.undercurrents/">when covering Palestine solidarity actions</a>. Other organizers and journalists have often reached out to me asking how I blur faces in my photos. Many people don't have access to or aren't comfortable with tools like Photoshop, and blurring photos manually can be time-intensive, so I thought there was a need for a tool like this.</p>
            <p>Other student-organizer-developers have also contributed to the development of this app, and <a href="https://github.com/wwsalmon/blurryface">you can too if you have web development experience!</a></p>
